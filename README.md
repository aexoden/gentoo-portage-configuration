The following flags are not currently enabled, because I don't believe I've ever
actually made use of them, despite enabling them previously:

* debug

* doc

* emacs

* examples

* kerberos: Could potentially be useful in an enterprise environment, but seems
  useless to the typical home user. 

* static-libs

* test
